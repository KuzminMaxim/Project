# Project
Project concept:
This project works as follows:
The person after registration, and further authorization puts an end to the proposed map. Thus, he creates an event that will be visible to all other users.
At the same time, a general chat is generated.
The person sets the theme for this event.
Other people who saw this event on the shared map can join it.
When connected, they will get into the general chat.
If a person wants to find an event in which he will participate, then he can use the search.
The person who created the event can also delete it.
Project structure:
1. Add Event
1.1 A person sees a map in front of him.
1.2 A person clicks on a specific location on this map.
1.3. A window pops up in front of a person in which it says: "Do you want to create a project?" and two answer choices: Yes and No.
If a person clicks "No", he returns to the map.
1.4 When you click on the "Yes" button, a window pops up that says: "Write the subject of the event", "Write the time of the event", and there are two buttons: "Create" and "Cancel".
1.5 When you click on the "Create" button, an event is created.
When you click on the "Cancel" button, the person returns back to the map.
