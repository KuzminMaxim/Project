# Project
Project concept:
This project works as follows:
The person after registration, and further authorization puts an end to the proposed map. Thus, he creates an event that will be visible to all other users.
At the same time, a general chat is generated.
The person sets the theme for this event.
Other people who saw this event on the shared map can join it.
When connected, they will get into the general chat.
If a person wants to find an event in which he will participate, then he can use the search.
The person who created the event can also delete it.
